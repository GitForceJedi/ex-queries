***DELETE DUPLICATE Data:

(PostgreSQL):
DELETE FROM users
WHERE ctid NOT IN (
  SELECT MIN(ctid)
  FROM users
  GROUP BY name, email
);


DELETE FROM users
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT MIN(id)
  FROM users
  GROUP BY name, email
);

Explanation:
GROUP BY name, email groups rows that are duplicates based on those columns.

MIN(id) ensures only the row with the smallest id is kept.

The outer DELETE removes all other rows not in that group.


***Display the highest and lowest salary corresponding to each department:

SELECT 
  department,
  MAX(salary) AS highest_salary,
  MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

Explanation:
GROUP BY department groups rows by each unique department.

MAX(salary) and MIN(salary) calculate the highest and lowest salary per group.

The result gives you one row per department with its salary range.

-- Highest paid employee per department
SELECT DISTINCT ON (department)
  department,
  name AS highest_paid_employee,
  salary AS highest_salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY department, salary DESC;

-- Lowest paid employee per department
SELECT DISTINCT ON (department)
  department,
  name AS lowest_paid_employee,
  salary AS lowest_salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY department, salary ASC;

-- Highest / Lowest employee combined:
WITH ranked_salaries AS (
  SELECT
    department,
    name,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank_desc,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary ASC) AS salary_rank_asc
  FROM employees
)
SELECT
  d.department,
  h.name AS highest_paid_employee,
  h.salary AS highest_salary,
  l.name AS lowest_paid_employee,
  l.salary AS lowest_salary
FROM 
  (SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees) d
LEFT JOIN ranked_salaries h
  ON d.department = h.department AND h.salary_rank_desc = 1
LEFT JOIN ranked_salaries l
  ON d.department = l.department AND l.salary_rank_asc = 1;


***Get Actual Distance Traveled Per Day:
SELECT
  cars,
  days,
  cumulative_distance,
  cumulative_distance - COALESCE(LAG(cumulative_distance) OVER (
    PARTITION BY cars ORDER BY days
  ), 0) AS actual_distance
FROM car_travels
ORDER BY cars, days;

Here's what each part does:
LAG(cumulative_distance): looks at the value of the previous row in the window.

OVER (...): tells SQL how to define that "window" of rows.

PARTITION BY cars: restarts the window calculation for each car.

ORDER BY days: defines the order in which to apply the LAG() function — essentially, which day is considered "previous".


***Schedule where each team plays every other team once:
You can use a self-join with a filter to prevent duplicate matchups and self-matches.

SELECT 
  t1.team_name AS home_team,
  t2.team_name AS away_team
FROM teams t1
JOIN teams t2 ON t1.team_id < t2.team_id
ORDER BY home_team, away_team;

Explanation:
t1.team_id < t2.team_id ensures each unique pairing only shows once, and a team doesn’t play itself.

You get a list of matches like:

Yankees vs Red Sox

Yankees vs Dodgers

Yankees vs Cubs

Red Sox vs Dodgers

etc.

***Schedule where each team plays every other team twice (home and away):

This time, just avoid self-matches, but allow both directions of the pairing.

SELECT 
  t1.team_name AS home_team,
  t2.team_name AS away_team
FROM teams t1
JOIN teams t2 ON t1.team_id <> t2.team_id
ORDER BY home_team, away_team;

***Generate All Home/Away Matchups With Dates
WITH matchups AS (
  SELECT 
    t1.team_name AS home_team,
    t2.team_name AS away_team
  FROM teams t1
  JOIN teams t2 ON t1.team_id <> t2.team_id
),
numbered_games AS (
  SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER () - 1 AS game_number,
    home_team,
    away_team
  FROM matchups
)
SELECT 
  home_team,
  away_team,
  DATE '2025-05-01' + game_number AS game_date
FROM numbered_games
ORDER BY game_date;


***Show the total sales (in dollars), total items sold, and number of distinct orders per customer per product category, only for customers in the 'West' region who have more than 2 orders.

SELECT 
  c.name AS customer_name,
  p.category AS product_category,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) AS total_orders,
  SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_items_sold,
  SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) AS total_sales
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
JOIN products p ON p.id = oi.product_id
WHERE c.region = 'West'
GROUP BY c.id, p.category
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) > 2
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

For customers in the "West" region who have placed more than two orders, the query finds:

How many distinct orders they made

How many total items they bought

How much money they spent

This is grouped by each product category they purchased

# FROM & JOINs
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
JOIN products p ON p.id = oi.product_id
We are combining 4 tables:

customers → has customer details (name, region)

orders → each order linked to a customer

order_items → each product in an order (quantity)

products → product details like category and price

Why join them?

We need to link everything from customer → order → item → product, to answer business-level questions like sales per customer per product category.

# WHERE Clause

WHERE c.region = 'West'
This filters the results early to only include customers from the 'West' region

It helps improve performance by cutting down the dataset before aggregation

# SELECT & Aggregates

SELECT 
  c.name AS customer_name,
  p.category AS product_category,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) AS total_orders,
  SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_items_sold,
  SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) AS total_sales
Each selected column:
c.name: the customer's name

p.category: product category they’ve bought from

COUNT(DISTINCT o.id): number of unique orders

SUM(oi.quantity): how many items they bought in total

SUM(oi.quantity * p.price): total dollars spent = quantity × price

# GROUP BY Clause

GROUP BY c.id, p.category
We're grouping the data per customer and product category

So if one customer buys both "Electronics" and "Books", they will appear in two rows, one per category.

# HAVING Clause

HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) > 2
After grouping, we filter out customers who have 2 or fewer unique orders

This is a post-aggregation filter, so it uses HAVING (not WHERE)

#ORDER BY Clause

ORDER BY total_sales DESC
Sort the results so that the highest spenders appear first

Helps visualize top customers/categories at a glance

### Window Version:
SELECT 
  c.name AS customer_name,
  c.region,
  p.category AS product_category,
  SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_items_sold,
  SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) AS total_sales_by_category,

  -- Window Function #1: Total sales by customer across all categories
  SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) OVER (PARTITION BY c.id) AS total_sales_all_categories,

  -- Window Function #2: Rank of customer by total sales in their region
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.region ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * p.price) DESC) AS regional_rank

FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
JOIN products p ON p.id = oi.product_id

WHERE c.region = 'West'

GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.region, p.category
ORDER BY total_sales_all_categories DESC;

# Explanation of Window Functions
# SUM(...) OVER (PARTITION BY c.id)
Computes total sales for each customer across all categories

Unlike GROUP BY, this lets us show:

One row per category per customer

AND the customer’s grand total alongside each row

# RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.region ORDER BY SUM(...) DESC)
Gives each customer a ranking within their region

Ranks are based on total sales (across all categories)

Same total = same rank (RANK), or use DENSE_RANK / ROW_NUMBER depending on needs

### CTE Version:
WITH base_data AS (
  SELECT
    c.id AS customer_id,
    c.name AS customer_name,
    c.region,
    p.category,
    oi.quantity,
    p.price,
    (oi.quantity * p.price) AS line_total,
    o.id AS order_id
  FROM customers c
  JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
  JOIN order_items oi ON oi.order_id = o.id
  JOIN products p ON p.id = oi.product_id
  WHERE c.region = 'West'
),

category_summary AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    region,
    category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_items_sold,
    SUM(line_total) AS total_sales_by_category
  FROM base_data
  GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name, region, category
),

final_result AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    -- Total sales by customer across all categories
    SUM(total_sales_by_category) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS total_sales_all_categories,

    -- Ranking customers by sales in their region
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY SUM(total_sales_by_category) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) DESC) AS regional_rank
  FROM category_summary
)

SELECT *
FROM final_result
WHERE total_orders > 2
ORDER BY total_sales_all_categories DESC;

#Breakdown of Each CTE
1. base_data
Gets all necessary details in one place (joined and enriched with line_total)

Only pulls West region customers

2. category_summary
Aggregates:

How many orders per category (COUNT(DISTINCT order_id))

How many items sold

How much was spent per category

3. final_result
Adds window functions:

Total sales across all categories for each customer

Ranks customers by their overall sales in their region
